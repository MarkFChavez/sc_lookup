### Setup / Usage
```
$ bin/run <file>
```

### Running Tests
```
$ bin/rspec
```

### Assumptions
- The input file contains consistent format/structure.

### Limitations
- Fixed search parameters if running from command line.

### Further Improvements
- Do not require file initially and allow uses to just do `bin/run`.
- Better command-line experience.
- Smarter suggestions of column to search for when ran from command line.
- Add multi-column search.
